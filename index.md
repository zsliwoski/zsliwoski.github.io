#Chapter 1

Dodo/Scrat: Ye!

Diego: Listen! I can help you!
Manny: It's ok Sid we'll find our way out.
Manny: It's ok Sid, we'll find our way out.
Diego: You can't the currents too strong, you have to trust me.
Manny: Trust you!? Why on Earth would we trust you!?
Manny: Trust you! Why on Earth would we trust you?
Diego: Because I'm your only chance.

Diego: Get down! Get down, and follow me.
Manny: What are you saying?
Diego: There's an ambush waiting for you.
Manny: What do you mean ambush.....? You set us up.
Diego: I was my job. I was supposed to bring the baby, then....
Manny: You brought us home for dinner!!!
Sid: That's it, you're out of the herd!
Diego: I'm sorry.
Manny: No, you're not! Not, yet!

Diego: Give it up Sid. You know humans can't talk.
Sid: Diego!!
Sid: Diego!
Diego: Nine lives, baby.

Rhino: Save it for a mammal that cares.
Sid: I'm a mammal that cares.

Diego: Whoo, YEAH! Who's up for round TWO? [pause; embarrassed] Um, t-t-tell the kid to be more careful.

Sid: Well, I think mating for life is stupid. I mean, there's plenty of Sid to go around.

Diego: I've heard of these crackpots.

Diego: The baby? Please. I was just returning it to its herd.
Sid: Oh, yeah. Nice try, Bucktooth.
Diego: You calling me a liar?
Sid: I didn't say that.
Diego: You were thinking it.
Sid: [whispering, to Manny] I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

Sid: [about the baby] I bet he's hungry.
Manny: How 'bout some milk?
Sid: Ooh, I'd love some!
Diego: Not you. The baby.
Sid: Well, I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.
Diego: You're a little low on the food chain to be mouthing off, aren't you...
Manny: [in a shout that echoes] ENOUGH!

Manny: Diego, spit that out. You don't know where it's been.

Manny: [watching the dodos] Hey, look at that. Dinner and a show.

Sid: From now on, you'll have to refer to me as "Sid, Lord of the Flame."
Sid: From now on, you'll have to refer to me as 'Sid, Lord of the Flame.'
Manny: Hey, Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

Sid: Thanks for waiting. [lies down on geyser]
Manny: [with Diego] Three, two, one. [geyser shoots Sid up in the air]
Manny: Sure is faithful. [baby claps]

Sid: They left without me. They do this every year. Why? Doesn't anyone love me? Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?

Female Sloth: It's so hard to find a family guy.
Female Sloth: Tell me about it. All the sensitive ones get eaten.

Diego: Not you! The baby!

Sid: [Arguing with Diego] I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal!

Sid: Hey, Manny. Aren't you forgettin' somethin'?

Zeke: He said, "Come back with the baby, or don't come back at all!" [Laughs evilly]
Zeke: He said, 'Come back with the baby, or don't come back at all!' [laughs evilly]

Roshan: [Repeated line] WAAAAHHHH!!!
Roshan: [repeated line] WAAAAHHHH!

Rhino: Who says we're gonna eat him after we kill him?
Rhino: Yeah. Come on. Move it.

Rhino: Save it for a mammal that cares.

Soto: [About to attack Manny] Let's bring this mammoth down!
Soto: [about to attack Manny] Let's bring this mammoth down!

Sid: Diego, you hold the baby.

Sid: [To Diego, referring to Roshan] Here, you hold it.
Sid: [to Diego, referring to Roshan] Here, you hold it.
Diego: [Bonks Sid on the head, who sticks his tongue out; then he shakes his head and wakes up]
Diego: [bonks Sid on the head, who sticks his tongue out; then he shakes his head and wakes up]

Diego: Where's the baby? There he is! Where's the baby? THERE HE IS!!
Diego: [playing peek-a-boo] Where's the baby?... There he is! [the baby's only reaction is blinking; it is so startled it's quieted]
Diego: [playing peek-a-boo] Where's the baby? There he is! [the baby's only reaction is blinking; it is so startled it's quieted]
Roshan: [Cries]
Diego: Where's the baby?There he is!
Manny: Stop it! You're scarin' him!
Manny: [the baby begins crying again] Stop it, you're scaring him!

Diego: Name's Diego, friend.

Manny: You know, I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.
Rhino: Save it for a mammal that cares.
Sid: I'm a mammal that cares!

Sid: They left without me. They do this every year! Why?! Doesn't anyone love me?! Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?!
Sid: They left without me. They do this every year! Why?! Doesn't anyone love me?! Isn't there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?

Manny: I'm-not-going!

Sid: Sexy!

Diego: That pink thing is mine.

Manny: I'm not fat. It's all this fur. It makes me look... poofy.
Manny: I'm not fat. It's all this fur. It makes me look... poofy.
